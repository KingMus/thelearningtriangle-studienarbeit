# The Learning Triangle - Studienarbeit

This repository includes the necessary files for the studienarbeit. It will be written in LaTeX. We will use Overleaf as a platform, you can view our [Studienarbeit](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mjzjqdfzgjfv) there.

Visit our [YouTrack](https://thelearningtriangle.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/dashboard) for more information about our procedure.

It also contains the documents for the subject "Projektmanagement".

We used Unity, so the code isn't on GitHub yet. But you can visit [this](https://github.com/KingMus/thelearningtriangle) repository to see the old code, where TLT wasn't an Educational Game yet, but a simulation of intelligent life.
